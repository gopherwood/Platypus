/**
# COMPONENT **node**
This component causes an entity to be a position on a [[node-map]]. This component should not be confused with `node-resident` which should be used on entities that move around on a node-map: `node` simply represents a non-moving location on the node-map.

## Dependencies
- [[node-map]] (on entity's parent) - This component uses the `node-map` to determine its location and navigate to other nodes.
- [[handler-logic]] (on entity's parent) - This component listens for a logic tick message to maintain and update its location.

## Messages

### Listens for:
- **handle-logic** - On a `tick` logic message, the component updates its location and triggers messages regarding its neighbors.
  - @param message.delta (Number) - This component uses the current time to determine its progress along an edge if moving from node to node on the map.
- **on-node** - Sets the entity's position to the sent node, updates its coordinates, and triggers messages regarding its neighbors if any.
  - @param node (Node) - The node that this entity should be located on.
- **leave-node** - Removes the entity from its current node if it's on one.
- **goto-node** - Begins moving the entity along edges to get to sent node.
  - @param node (Node) - The node that this entity should move to.
- **follow** - Causes this entity to follow another entity. The leading entity must also have a `node-resident` component and exist in the node-map.
  - @param entity (Entity) - The entity that this entity should follow.

### Local Broadcasts:
- **next-to-[entity-type]** - This message is triggered when the entity is placed on a node. It will trigger on all neighboring entities, as well as on itself on behalf of neighboring entities.
  - @param entity (Entity) - The entity that is next to the listening entity.
- **with-[entity-type]** - This message is triggered when the entity is placed on a node. It will trigger on all entities residing on the same node, as well as on itself on behalf of all resident entities.
  - @param entity (Entity) - The entity that is with the listening entity.
- **left-node** - Triggered when the entity leaves a node.
  - @param node (Node) - The node that the entity just left.
- **[Messages specified in definition]** - When the entity is placed on a node, it checks out the type of node and triggers a message on the entity if an event is listed for the current node type.

## States
- **on-node** - This state is true when the entity is on a node.
- **moving** - This state is true when the entity is moving from one node to another.
- **going-[direction]** - This state is true when the entity is moving (or has just moved) in a direction (determined by the node-map) from one node to another.

      "nodes": ['path','sidewalk','road'],
      // Optional. This is a list of node types that this entity can reside on. If not set, entity can reside on any type of node.
